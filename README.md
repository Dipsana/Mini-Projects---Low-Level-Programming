# Mini-Projects---Low-Level-Programming

This repository contains a collection of mini projects focused on low-level programming concepts, primarily written in C. These projects demonstrate fundamental data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming techniques. Each project is well-documented, making it easy for beginners and experienced developers to navigate and understand.  

ðŸ”¹ **Categories Covered:**  
- **Data Structures:** Implementation of linked lists, stacks, queues, and more.  
- **Algorithms:** Efficient sorting, searching, and problem-solving techniques.  
- **File Handling:** Reading, writing, and managing files in C.  
- **Memory Management:** Dynamic allocation and optimization of memory usage.  
- **System Programming:** Low-level operations, process handling, and OS interactions.

As I continue learning, more projects and additional languages like C++ and Shell Scripting will be added in separate folders. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
